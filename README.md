# V-Comply


Front end is in React.

The following implementation were taken:

Daily:
  The user can set an alert for doing something every day in a specific time.
  Just like setting an alarm that gets initiated everyday at a particular time.

Weekly:
  The user can set an alert on a particular time on the same day but for a duration of week.
  Again going with the alarm clock analogy, the alarm will ring on the same day at the same time but a week apart.

Monthly:
  the user can set an alert on the same time but for a duration of a month or 30 days.
  
Yearly:
  the user can set an alert on the same date and time an year from when he set it.
  
One time(Once):
  the user can set an alert on a particular date at a particular time in a particular year, and it will be executed only ONCE!


How to run:
  The react app is in a folder called client, so when you are in that folder, just running npm start will do it.
  And the node app which is named index.js can be run by just typing into the command node index.js.
